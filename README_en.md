# Workshop: _Creating an interactive serverless application using WebSocket_

In this workshop, we will create a serverless app in Node.js using WebSocket step by step.

We will be using the following services and software:

* IntelliJ IDEA Community Edition
* Serverless Framework
* Yandex API Gateway
* Yandex Cloud CLI, AWS CLI, and YDB CLI
* Yandex Cloud Functions
* Yandex Database
* Yandex Data Streams
* Yandex Lockbox
* Yandex Message Queue
* Yandex Object Storage

We will be working in the terminal, console, and IDE.

Our workflow is clearly divided into steps. Before each step, you will see visual aids and its explained walkthrough. Then, you will be able to complete the step on your own. For each step, there is a respective folder in [./steps](./steps).

In the step folder, there is a `README.md` file with detailed guidance and command sections. Copy those sections by clicking them, and then paste the relevant one into your terminal.

Now it is time to [set up your environment](./steps/0-init/README.md): this step is crucial, as otherwise you will not be able to fully participate in the workshop.
